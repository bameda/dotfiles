* MPD - Music Player Daemon

  I have been using =spotify= to listen and organize my music, but
  now that I want to have my collection locally, I'm going to move
  from =mopidy= to raw =mpd=.

  #+BEGIN_SRC shell-script :tangle ~/.mpd/mpd.conf :padline no :mkdirp yes
    music_directory    "~/Music"
    playlist_directory "~/.mpd/playlists"
    db_file            "~/.mpd/mpd.db"
    log_file           "~/.mpd/mpd.log"
    pid_file           "~/.mpd/mpd.pid"
    state_file         "~/.mpd/mpdstate"
    audio_output {
        type  "alsa"
        name  "ALSA device"
    }
  #+END_SRC

  Before the first launch of the =mpd= server you should execute the
  following commands:

  #+BEGIN_SRC shell-script :tangle no
    touch ~/.mpd/mpd.db
    mkdir -p ~/.mpd/playlists
  #+END_SRC
